# 🚦 Industry Level Project: Traffic Sign Recognition (CNN)

## Overview
This project represents the completion of **Task 8 (Industry Level)** in the Elevvo Machine Learning Internship. The goal was to build a robust model capable of classifying the 43 different types of traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. This project demonstrates proficiency in **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**.

## Key Outcomes and Techniques
The solution employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and advanced image processing techniques to achieve high accuracy:

1.  **Image Preprocessing:** Images were loaded, converted to Grayscale (single channel), resized to **(32x32)**, and normalized (0-255 to 0-1) to standardize the input for the CNN.
2.  **CNN Architecture:** A custom Sequential CNN model was designed using multiple `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers, followed by `Dropout` layers to prevent overfitting.
3.  **Data Augmentation (Bonus):** Applied an `ImageDataGenerator` with transformations (rotation, zoom, shift) to artificially expand the training dataset, significantly boosting the model's generalization capabilities.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Performance was measured on a separate test set, confirming the model's robustness.
